# Ionic JavaScript SDK

More details about this sample can be found on our [developer portal](https://dev.ionic.com/getting-started/web-javascript.html)

## Requirements

* Google Chrome

## Enrollment

In order for your application to communicate with Ionic, authenticate, and receive securely transferred keys, you must have an Ionic Profile.

Because browsers are sandboxed applications, the Profile needs to be created and saved inside the browser -- we will not be able to use profiles created with other tools or SDKs.
Ionic's Enrollment Service has tools built-in to use configured IdPs to handle the complexities of authentication and enrollment.

Profiles created for the JavaScript SDK are saved in the browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
Three fields are used to save, and lookup the correct profile for a given user - userId - and a given application - appId.
The Profile is encrypted with a key generated by the userAuth.

> NOTE: In future versions of the SDK profiles will also be cataloged by application domain as well.  This will require users to re-enroll with the next version of the SDK.

The code in this sample will open the enrollment service in a new tab, where the user will authenticate with Ionic, and a Profile will be created for them for your application.

## Run

Due to the security contraints placed around the SDK, it cannot be opened from a file, it must be served from an HTTP host.  This is because we validate the origin of the page, and Chrome cannot resolve the `file://` origin.

The simplest way to run the sample is with the tool [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
This tool will turn your current directory into a static server.

~~~bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server .
~~~

Open your Chrome browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080
